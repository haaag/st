## Fonts

- Install [Maple Mono Font](https://github.com/subframe7536/maple-font/releases)

## Installation

Edit config.mk to match your local setup (st is installed into
the /usr/local namespace by default).

Afterwards enter the following command to build and install st (if
necessary as root):

```sh
sudo make install
```

## Running st

If you did not install st with make clean install, you must compile
the st terminfo entry with the following command:

```sh

```

See the man page for additional details.
